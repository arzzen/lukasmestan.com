What is the single most important factor determining the programmer level? 
This is the question which can be answer each programmer (or your boss).

The initial idea of an assessment matrix appeared during find level of skills for new hired programmer. 
The concrete form as presented here was further developed thanks to inspiration from Sijin Joseph.

It’s not overly scientific (he states he spent an afternoon on it), it makes no claim about predicting work-place 
skills or productivity, although it does imply a higher score means a better programmer.

It’s still a cool and thorough starting point to think about programming skill measurements.

There's no scientific research behind this test of what programmers ought to know, 
and some of the categorizations are unactionably vague, but it's still a useful guide. 

It might be good foundation for systematization of evaluation metrics in your organization. 
Also, it can be used as roadmap for individual education plan.

Using the questionnaire below, you can assess your level of programming proficiency. 
Proficiency is about the programming activity, in contrast to other tests for programming knowledge.

**Questionnaire is divided into 5 activity domains:**

- Computer Science
- Software Engineering
- Programming
- Experience
- Knowledge

## Test your own skills:

Filling this questionnaire takes around ten minutes.
