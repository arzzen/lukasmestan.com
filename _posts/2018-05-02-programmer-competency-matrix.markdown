description: What is the single most important factor determining the programmer level?

What is the most important factor determining the programmer's level? 
This is the question which programmer or his boss might ask himself, for example during (self)evaluation.

The initial idea of an competency matrix arose as a results of finding skill level for new hired programmers by Sijin Joseph. 
I thing this issue is still very useful and up to date. Inspired by this competency matrix, I have created 
questionnaire which might help you uncover your actual programming level. 

This questionnaire migth also help you find out domains which you can improve at. 
It might be a good base for systematization of your (company) evaluation. 
(It can be used as roadmap, eg.: for personal/company education plan.)

Using the questionnaire below, you can assess your level of programming skills. 

**Questionnaire is divided into 5 domains:**

- Computer Science
- Software Engineering
- Programming
- Experience
- General overview

## Test your own skills:

Filling this questionnaire in takes around 15 minutes.
