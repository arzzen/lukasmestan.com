## Me...

Technology is my passion, and has always been since I was a kid. In particular, 
I have always been interested in programming, and all the technologies 
which nowadays make it possible to easily share information and communicate across 
the globe.

Apart from the usual coding, I particularly love researching into best practices 
and exploring new techniques related to web programming. 
However, my interest in technology has no boundaries.
